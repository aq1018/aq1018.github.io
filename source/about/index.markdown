My name is Aaron Qian. I have more than 6 years of professional experience
with Ruby and Rails development, 16 years of programming experience
from both professional work and personal projects. Other than programming,
I am also interested in politics, philosophy, economics, physics, astronomy and
general science. Yes. I'm a hardcore geek.


## Daytime Hacker

When I say Hacker, please don't get nervous. I am not that type of hack that infiltrates
people's computers and steal valuable information. Hacker in developer's circles means
a skilled programmer. I build web applications, games, and utilities.

Currently, I work at [yp.com](http://yp.com) as a Ruby developer.
Programming is both my hobby and my carrier, and I'm very good at what I do! Lucky me.

Lately, I've been really impressed with how simple and performance node.js is,
and secretly working on something that might bring Reactor Pattern, Performance,
and Clean API together in ruby. I know, there are a couple Reactor Patterns
such as EventMachine in ruby already. However, they all lack certain aspects as I
mentioned earlier, and I hope to fill the gap by providing something different.

## Nighttime Philosopher

My personal life is geeky to the core. I would ponder about the depth of the universe,
debate about our economic policies, and make arguments on the impact of government
regulations on economic and moral values our society.

To sum it up, I have a genuine interest in knowledge and truth.
Reading about astrophysics or philosophy of big government vs small government could keep me
going all night. I have a firm belief in the goodness of human nature,
and a strong support for human freedom as well as individual responsibility.
I try my best to understand the world that we live in by learning and analysing stories from
different angles, sources, and perspectives.

I believe it is especially important in today's world that we can make a judgement with a clear
sight. It is not the time to sit idly watching NFL with a beer in hand and pretending
everything is OK or believing the society will bail you out. It is not in line with my belief
of individual responsibility. One thing I am clear, no one will save me but me.

To me, this is survival. :)
