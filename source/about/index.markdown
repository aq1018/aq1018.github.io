## AQ = Aaron Qian

Hello! Aaron Qian here. I am a software developer.
Programming has always been my carrier and my hobby.
And yes, I love to write beautiful code!

Ever since the first time I encountered a monochrome monitor in my
elementary school's computer lab, I have fallen in love with programming.
My first programming language was Logo. I started programming in QBasic when
I was 13 years old. And have already made several simple games in junior high.
I started to learn C and C++ in high school and made my first graphical game
in my senior year. Around year 2000 is when I started to take interest in
making websites, and it has been my main focus ever since.

After graduating from UC Irvine, I started mostly working on Ruby on Rails based
websites. Over time, I had worked with high profile companies such as
[YellowPages](http://yp.com),
[Sony Music](http://www.sonymusic.com),
[NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com).
Along the way, I have always chosen to face the most difficult programming
challenges. Overtime, I have gained tremendously from coming up with solutions
for those difficult problems. I can now architect and deliver high-throughput,
low-latency, and fault-tolerant applications with style.

If you are interested in my work, you can always find my open source projects
on [my github page](https://github.com/aq1018).
