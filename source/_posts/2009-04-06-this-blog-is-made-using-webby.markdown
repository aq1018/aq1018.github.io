After a few days of work, I finally finished the layout for my blog.
During the construction of this blog, I wanted to use a very light framework.
Being mainly a Ruby On Rails developer I found a ruby framework called
[Webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/) that works perfectly with my requirements.

From the Webby describes itself as:

> Webby is a fantastic little website management system.
> It would be called a content management system if it were a bigger kid.
> But, it’s just a runt with a special knack for transforming text.
> And that’s really all it does – manages the legwork of turning text into something else,
> an ASCII Alchemist if you will."

Sounds nice?

It supports ERB, haml, sass, Textile, Markdown and a set of other
arsenels you can use at your disposal. Another reason I choose Webby
is because it supports [UltraViolet](http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/)
which comes in handy when you need to demonstrate a few lines of code.
Even though it also supports [CodeRay](http://coderay.rubychan.de/),
but I much perfer UltraViolet as it supports a lot more
css hightlighting templates and languages.

Another highlight of Webby is that it uses A CSS framework called
[BluePrint](http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/)This little CSS
framework makes website layout a breeze. Plus it has a powerful
customization utility that can generate custom sized grid with
meaningful class names.

##What about commenting?

As Maxime once commented about my idea of using Webby to generate a static Blog:

> "A blog without comments aint a blog!"

Sure, you've got a point! My answer to this problem is [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).
It provides a JavaScript Widget that handles all the blog comments for you.
No more custom coding for comments, wrestling with SPAM, etc.
Just drop in their code, and sit and relax.
You've got a powerful commenting system on your blog already! Sweet...

##Lastly, a Gift if you care

if the idea of making a blog with Webby sounds nice to you,
maybe you can give it a try as well!

Anyways, it was a lot of fun playing around using this little powerful framework,
and through fun experiments, a blog is actually born! Life is beautiful...
