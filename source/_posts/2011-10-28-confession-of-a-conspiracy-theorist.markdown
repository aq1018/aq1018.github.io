Dear readers, the lunacy of a conspiracy theorist is scientifically proven to be more contagious than dog food! If you or your family has a history of immune system dysfunction, it is advised to consult your doctor before reading. You have been warned.

# My Confession

I am a die-hard conspiracy theorist. In fact, I am probably one of the most hard core. Among many other conspiracies I believe that 9-11 is an insider job, that the New World Order is real, that Economics is as unscientific as Global Warming, and that the Federal Reserve is stealing our future through manipulation of currency. 

"This guy must be a nut crack! He is either high or got brain damage to take these _conspiracy theories_ seriously", you probably start to evaluate my mental conditions subconsciously. I don't blame you. I am probably insane.

# My Insanity

Diving deeply into my own mind, after careful analysis, I did find a few rather abnormal aspects about myself. I guess I _am_ insane after all. Yes. I am insane because I still remember that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty". I am insane because I question our chronically dishonest government. I am insane because I see a world economic calamity and worry deeply about the fate of humanity. I am insane because I see a system that is rotten to the core and dysfunction beyond belief. I am insane because I value morality over profit and believe in the goodness of human nature. I am insane because I choose a path of truth seeking instead of a path of TV watching and beer drinking. I am insane because I see our freedom slowly eroding away and determined to fight to the death. And yes! I AM INSANE!!
