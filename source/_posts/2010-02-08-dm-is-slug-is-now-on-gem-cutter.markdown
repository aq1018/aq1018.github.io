h3. I'm so forgetful

I created a "datamapper":http://datamapper.org plugin called "dm-is-slug":http://github.com/aq1018/dm-is-slug in 2009 to ease the pain of handling permalinks or url slugs in my "merb":http://www.merbivore.com project. I have to admit, I have totally forgotten about it until now!

So, I spent some time merging commits from "Alex Mankuta":http://github.com/cheba whom has fixed many bugs, and now it works much better. Thanks, cheba!

I also added support for "unidecoding":http://rubyforge.org/projects/unidecode/, which allows you to turn strings like _"你好"_ into _"ni-hao"_.

Lastly, the gem is pushed to "gemcutter":http://gemcutter.org for easy gem install. That didn't take too long! :)
