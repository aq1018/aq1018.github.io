I created a [datamapper](http://datamapper.org) plugin called
[dm-is-slug](http://github.com/aq1018/dm-is-slug) in 2009 to
ease the pain of handling permalinks or url slugs in my
[merb](http://www.merbivore.com project).

So, I spent some time merging commits from [Alex Mankuta](http://github.com/cheba)
whom has fixed many bugs, and now it works much better. Thanks, cheba!

I also added support for [unidecoding](http://rubyforge.org/projects/unidecode/),
which allows you to turn strings like _"你好"_ into _"ni-hao"_.

Lastly, the gem is pushed to [gemcutter](http://gemcutter.org)
for easy gem install. That didn't take too long! :)
